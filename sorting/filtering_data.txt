By defalt, ORDER BY orders in ascending order

To order a single column in ascending or descending order:

SELECT column1, column2, column3 ...
FROM <table_name>
ORDER BY <column_name> ASC;       or       DESC;



To order multiple columns seperately in ascending or descending order:

SELECT column1, column2, column3 ...
FROM <table_name>
ORDER BY <column1> ASC/DESC, <column2> ASC/DESC;



To take multiple columns into account for either ascending or descending order when displaying a table

SELECT *
FROM <table_name>
ORDER BY <column1>, <column2>      or     <column1> DESC, <column2> DESC;




SELECT DISTINCT:

It is used to return only a single occurence of each value when there are duplicate values. e.g.

SELECT DISTINCT <table_name>
FROM <database_name>

When selecting multiple columns in a table, then it will only output unique combinations. e.g.


SELECT DISTINCT faculty, country FROM student_tbl;


outputs....


faculty             country

Science             USA
Science             Australia
Science             UK
Engineering         China
Engineering         UK
Engineering         USA

None of the combinations are alike


Note that Null values count as their own unique value. So there may be combinations including Null values and some other value
